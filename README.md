## Machine Checked Proofs of Vote Privacy using Computationally Complete Symbolic Attacker (CCSA)

We formalized the property of vote privacy of the FOO voting protocol using the CCSA technique in the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/).

## Prerequisites

* To compile the files, you will need to have installed Coq on your local machine.

### Installing

* To download and install Coq on your machine, click on the link [install coq](https://coq.inria.fr/download).

### Compile the proofs

* To compile all the files
   ```
   > make
   ```
  [//]: # (It took about **15 mins** to compile all the files on the **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** system with **Intel Core i5 3.20 GHz** processor and **8GiB RAM**)

* To compile a single file 
  ```
  > coqc filename.v
  ```

* To generate a new `Makefile` by typing
  ```
  > coq_makefile -install none -I . *.v -o Makefile
  ```

* HTML Coqdoc files can be generated by
  ```
  > coqdoc --html --toc --coqlib http://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/ -d _dirname_ *.v
  ```
* The directory webpages/coqdoc contains all the html files of the corresponding .v files
